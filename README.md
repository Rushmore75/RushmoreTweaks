# Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 BaseMod
 This is a Base Version of a basic Forge Mod (1.12.2)
 It was programmed using the latest IntelliJ IDEA version (you can just import it to IntelliJ by selecting the "build.gradlew"
 To be sure that everything is working properly, be sure to run the startDecompWorkspace task (locatable at the right side of IntelliJ, to start Minecraft, run the task startCLient)
 
  The base Mod is well commented, so really easy to understand and it even features some ready made Copper and Tin Items as well as an own Creative Tab entry!
